# 🌐 C Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) Dashboard  
A lightweight Threat Intelligence Platform written in C that ingests threat feeds, analyzes Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), correlates malicious activity, and generates security intelligence reports.

This project demonstrates low-level data parsing, security analytics, and intelligence processing.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Parse threat feeds (IP, domains, hashes)  
✔ IOC classification (Malicious / Suspicious / Unknown)  
✔ Threat scoring engine  
✔ Compare logs vs known-bad indicators  
✔ Real-time IOC lookup  
✔ Export report summaries  
✔ High-performance C-based processing
